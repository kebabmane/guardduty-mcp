 🚨 Immediate Priority: Fix DateTime Issue

  The logs show the datetime serialization error is still occurring. The fix I implemented isn't working because datetime objects are nested
  deeper in the AWS response. We need to recursively convert all datetime objects.

  🧪 1. Testing Infrastructure

  High Priority - Currently no tests exist
  - Unit tests for GuardDuty client methods
  - Integration tests for MCP server functionality
  - Mock AWS responses for reliable testing
  - Test coverage reporting with pytest-cov
  - CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions

  🔍 2. Enhanced GuardDuty Coverage

  Medium Priority - Expand AWS GuardDuty functionality
  - Organization management (master/member accounts)
  - Custom threat intelligence lists
  - GuardDuty Export functionality for data lakes
  - Threat IP/domain lookups
  - Suppression rules management
  - Publishing destinations for findings

  🛡️ 3. Production Readiness

  High Priority - Make it enterprise-ready
  - Input validation and sanitization
  - Rate limiting and backoff strategies
  - Comprehensive error handling with retry logic
  - Structured logging with correlation IDs
  - Health checks and monitoring endpoints
  - Configuration validation on startup

  📊 4. Performance & Scalability

  Medium Priority - Handle large-scale deployments
  - Response caching for frequently accessed data
  - Pagination support for large finding sets
  - Connection pooling for AWS clients
  - Async optimization throughout the codebase
  - Memory usage monitoring

  🔧 5. Developer Experience

  Medium Priority - Make it easier to use and extend
  - Enhanced CLI with more commands (validate, test-connection, etc.)
  - Configuration templates for different environments
  - Development mode with verbose logging
  - Hot reloading for development
  - API documentation with examples

  📈 6. Observability

  Low Priority - Production monitoring
  - Metrics collection (OpenTelemetry/Prometheus)
  - Performance tracking for API calls
  - Usage analytics for MCP tools
  - Alert thresholds for error rates
  - Dashboard templates

  🚀 7. Advanced Features

  Low Priority - Value-added functionality
  - Real-time webhooks for finding notifications
  - Integration with other AWS security services (Security Hub, Inspector)
  - Custom alerting rules and workflows
  - Data export capabilities (CSV, SIEM formats)
  - Threat hunting query helpers

  📦 8. Deployment & Operations

  Medium Priority - Production deployment
  - Docker containerization with multi-stage builds
  - Kubernetes manifests and Helm charts
  - Environment-specific configurations
  - Secrets management integration
  - Blue/green deployment strategies

  Recommended Next Steps:

  1. Fix the datetime serialization issue (immediate)
  2. Add comprehensive testing (week 1-2)
  3. Implement production-grade error handling (week 2-3)
  4. Add more GuardDuty tools (week 3-4)
  5. Create proper documentation (ongoing)

  Would you like me to start with any specific area? I'd recommend fixing the datetime issue first, then adding testing infrastructure to ensure
  reliability as we expand the functionality.
